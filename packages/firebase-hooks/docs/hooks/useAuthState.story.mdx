# Overview

`useAuthState` hook will subscribe to changes to the user's sign-in state. It will trigger an update
on user sign-in or sign-out, and will return a boolean that indicates if the user is
authenticated or not.

### This is a basic example.

In this example we are subcribing to the sign-in state to know if the user is authenticated.

```js
const isAuthenticated = useAuthState();

<RenderIf isTrue={isAuthenticated}>
    <MainPage />
</RenderIf>
<RenderIf isTrue={!isAuthenticated}>
    <LoginPage />
</RenderIf>
```

<Preview>
    <Story name="useAuthState">{stories.UseAuthState()}</Story>
</Preview>
