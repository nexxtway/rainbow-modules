# Overview

`useCollection` hook will subscribe to a firestore collection by providing the path e.g `/books`. It will return an tuple with [data, isLoading].

### This is a basic example.

In this example we are subcribing to a `/books` collection and rendering the result in a `Table`.

```js
const [data, isLoading] = useCollection({
    path: '/books',
});
```

<Preview>
    <Story name="useCollection">{stories.subcribeToCollection()}</Story>
</Preview>

### How to apply queries

In this example we are subcribing to a `/books` collection and applying a query only for `Axel Rauschmayer` as author.

```js
const [data, isLoading] = useCollection({
    path: '/books',
    query: (query) => query.where('author', '==', 'Axel Rauschmayer'),
});
```
