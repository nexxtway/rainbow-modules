# Overview

When our applications need to mutate(create/update/delete) data in the Server(database, etc, ...),
the UI we want to implement, 90% of the time does the same e.g.

1. show app/global spinner because we are about to do an `async` call.
2. call the `async` function that will communicate with our servers and make the desired mutation
3. on the success we want to:
    - hide the spinner
    - show visual feedback `notification` that explains `Success!`
4. on the error we want to:
    - hide the spinner
    - show visual feedback `notification` that explains `Error!`

<b>This is a very repetitive work!</b>

# Solution

## useMutationFlow() hook

```js
const saveBook = async (values) => { /* save a the book in DB. */};
const { mutate } = useMutationFlow({
    mutation: saveBook,
    successMessage: 'Book created sucessfully.',
    errorMessage: 'There was an error.Please try again.',
});
const values = { name: 'Foo', author: 'Bar', ... };
<Button label="Add Book" onClick={() => mutate(values)}
```

### How compose success|error messages based on the server response

```js
const { mutate } = useMutationFlow({
    mutation: saveBook,
    successMessage: (res) => `The book ${res.name} was created successfully.`,
});
```

### How close a Modal after success

```js
const { mutate } = useMutationFlow({
    mutation: saveBook,
    successMessage: (res) => `The book ${res.name} was created successfully.`,
    onSuccess: (res) => setModalOpen(false),
});
```

### How customize the icons on the notifications

```js
const { mutate } = useMutationFlow({
    mutation: saveBook,
    successMessage: (res) => ({
        description: `The book ${res.name} was created successfully.`,
        icon: <MyCustomIcon />,
    }),
    onSuccess: (res) => setModalOpen(false),
});
```
