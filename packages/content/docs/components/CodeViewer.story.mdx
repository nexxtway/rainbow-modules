# Overview

`CodeViewer` component provides a code explorer that renders a file tree on the left and the selected
file content on the right. The files are obtained from the return value of the function passed as
`onFolderExpand` prop and the file content from the function passed as `onFileSelect` prop.

When first rendered, the component will call `onFolderExpand` with `{ folderPath: '/' }` to get the
files of the root folder.

### This is a basic example.
