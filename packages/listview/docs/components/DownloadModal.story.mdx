# Overview

`DownloadModal` is a component to help you implement the functionality of downloading a file in JSON or CSV format on the client side. You need to provide an asynchronous function that is responsible for returning the data you want to download in the `onDownload` property.

### This is a basic example where you can download mock data.

<Preview>
    <Story name="DownloadModal">{stories.DefaultDownloadModal()}</Story>
</Preview>

# Component props

<Props of={DownloadModal} />
