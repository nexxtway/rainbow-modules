# Overview

`DraggableList` displays a collection of data as a re-orderable list. It is built on top of the [react-beautiful-dnd library](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

### This is a basic example.

#### By default the component will render the value that map the `field` prop value on every object item in the `data`. e.g. If field="name" for the first item will render `data[0].name`.

    <Story name="DraggableList">{stories.Basic()}</Story>

### Custom item component.

#### There are use cases where you want to render your custom UI for every item in the list. In that case, you can use the `component` prop that is a Function | Class Component, when internally the draggable component instantiates the component, it will pass down as properties the `value` and entire item object as `row` plus any other prop passed to the DragglableList.
